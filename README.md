# SVM-SMO

The SMO (sequential minimal Optimisation) algorithm, gives an efficient way of solving 
the dual problem arising from the derivation of the SVM. This tool provides an implementation 
of SVM with SMO, the tool has been developed from scratch without using libraries to help reader's 
understand math behind SVM!

# Installation

 1. Clone the SVM-SMO repo to your computer.
 2. cd SVM-SMO
 3. $ python3 main.py
